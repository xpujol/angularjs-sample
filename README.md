AngularJS Sample App
====================

Sample AngularJS App made by Xavier Pujol (github.com/xpujol).

The app provides a panel for adding, editing and deleting users from a certain website.
Users can also have some extra items attached to them (namely tools, makes and channels).

The app uses AngularJS's factories, controllers and directives,
and it uses ColdFusion as the back-end language.

Bear in mind that the goal of this repository is to show the structure and coding skills I used.
This is a real application built during my time at Carmen Data Ltd,
so some information has been obscured and some key technical details
have been removed, therefore the app will not work straight away if tested.
